# Job_posting_classifier

This project aims to create a web app classifier using Machine learning and Streamlit that will have the capability to identify fake and real jobs. It takes input features from the user in the web page and print whether the job is real/fake.

This project uses data provided from Kaggle which contains features that define a job posting. These job postings are categorized as either real or fake. Fake job postings are a very small fraction of this dataset(i.e, it is an imbalanced dataset), which is as excepted. We are using 8 features to check whether the job posting is fraudulent or not (i.e., Fake/Real).

The best performed model is Random Forest Classifier with an accuracy of 92%.
