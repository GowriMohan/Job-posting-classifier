# Job_posting_classifier

This project aims to create a classifier that will have the capability to identify fake and real jobs.
This project uses data provided from Kaggle which contains features that define a job posting. These job postings are categorized as either real or fake. Fake job postings are a very small fraction of this dataset, which is as excepted.


We are using 8 features to check whether the job posting is fraudulent or not (i.e., Fake/Real).

The best performed model is Random Forest Classifier with an accuracy of 92%.
